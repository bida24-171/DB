          Deja Brew is a family business that was founded by Leo James in 1960 and has been run by his descendants ever since. <br>
          Leo was working as a farmer and learned a lot about coffee beans as it was one of the crops being grown. <br>
          He would experiment with the beans and other ingredients during his breaks and when he was on leave until he <br> made a cup of coffee that he had never tasted his entire life.
          He would give his co-workers a sample during the breaks and get their reviews. <br>
          A woman he worked with gave him some tips on how he should start his own business but ended up running it together. <br>
          As time went on by, they got married using their life earnings from the coffee shop. <br>
          They had children who helped them keep their shop with loyal customers. <br>
          Deja Brew is currently open in the town of Mystic Falls and is still under the governance of the grandkids. <br>
          They are still on the aim to help their grandfather achieve his dream of blessing the world with his creation.
